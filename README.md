# Potato-Leaf-Disease-Detection-Using-CNN
This project, Potato Leaf Disease Detection Using CNN, leverages a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify potato leaf images into Early Blight, Late Blight, or Healthy categories with high accuracy. The model is trained on a structured dataset and includes features such as robust classification, confidence scoring, and visualization of predictions. Built using TensorFlow and Keras, the project is easy to extend and scalable for other plant diseases. Users can train the model, test it, and visualize results, making it a practical tool for agricultural disease diagnosis and prevention.
